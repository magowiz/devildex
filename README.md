**DevilDex is a desktop application for discovering, generating, and viewing Python package documentation (docsets).** It scans your projects for dependencies, builds their documentation, and provides a unified interface to browse it all locally.

It's designed for developers who want quick, offline access to the documentation of the libraries they use every day.

The name 'DevilDex' stems from a conceptual fusion reflecting its core mission: to be the **Developer Index**.

And have you seen the friendly little devil in the logo? Isn't it cute?

## Key Features üîë

- **Project Scanning**: Automatically scans your Python projects (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`) to find all their dependencies.
- **Docset Generation**: Uses tools like Sphinx, pdoc, and pydoctor to generate HTML documentation for your packages. ![Docset Generation Log](imgs/running_log.png)
- **Uniform Theming**: Applies a consistent and professional DevilDex theme across different documentation generators (Sphinx, pdoc3, pydoctor, MkDocs) for a unified viewing experience.
- **Integrated Viewer**: A built-in browser view to read and navigate the generated docsets without leaving the application. ![Docset View](imgs/docset.png)
- **Database Management**: Uses SQLAlchemy to keep track of your packages, projects, and available docsets.

- **Cross-Platform GUI**: Built with the wxPython framework to run on multiple operating systems.

## Release v0.2.0 is now available!
Check out the [releases page](https://github.com/magowiz/devildex/releases) for downloads and more information.

## Upcoming Release v0.2.0
This release will include improved CI/CD pipelines and comprehensive testing across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

### 1. System Dependencies
DevilDex, being a desktop application built with `wxPython`, relies on certain system-level libraries, especially for its webview component (`wx.html2.WebView`). While `pip install wxPython` handles most Python-level dependencies, you might need to install additional system packages depending on your operating system.

<details>
  <summary>Windows</summary>

Typically, no additional system dependencies are required beyond a standard Python installation, as `wxPython` wheels for Windows are usually self-contained.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>macOS</summary>

Similar to Windows, `pip install wxPython` should handle most dependencies. If you encounter issues, ensure you have Xcode Command Line Tools installed (`xcode-select --install`).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Linux</summary>

For Linux distributions, you'll generally need GTK3 development libraries and WebKit2GTK. The specific package names vary by distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Debian/Ubuntu-based systems</summary>

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
    libgirepository1.0-dev \
    gobject-introspection \
    gir1.2-gtk-3.0 \
    gir1.2-webkit2-4.1 \
    python3-gi \
    python3-gi-cairo \
    python3-wxgtk4.0 \
    python3-wxgtk-webview4.0
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Fedora-based systems</summary>

```bash
sudo dnf install -y \
    python3-wxpython4 \
    gtk3-devel \
    webkit2gtk4.1-devel
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Arch Linux-based systems</summary>

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu \
    python-wxpython \
    wxwidgets-gtk3 \
    webkit2gtk
```
</details>

</details>

### 2. Application Installation

DevilDex can be installed directly from a Python wheel package (`.whl`) if available, or from source for development purposes.

**Option A: Install from a Wheel Package (Recommended for Users)**

Wheel packages (`.whl`) are built and available as artifacts from successful GitHub Actions workflow runs. You can download the latest wheel from the [Build Python Wheel workflow](https://github.com/magowiz/devildex/actions/workflows/build-wheel.yml).

Once downloaded, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install path/to/your/downloaded/devildex-*.whl
```

<details>
  <summary>Note for Linux Users regarding wxPython</summary>

  On Linux, it is highly recommended to install `wxPython` and its dependencies (like `python3-wxgtk-webview4.0`) via your system\'s package manager (as described in the "System Dependencies" section) *before* installing the DevilDex wheel. When you run `pip install`, it will detect the system-wide `wxPython` installation and use it, preventing potential `NotImplementedError` issues with the WebView component.

</details>

**Option B: Install from Source (For Developers)**

For development or if you prefer to install from source, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd devildex
    ```

2. **Install Python packages using Poetry:**
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

## How to Run ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

Once everything is installed, you can run the application with:

```bash
poetry run devildex
```

## Registering a Project with DevilDex üìù

DevilDex needs to know about your projects and their associated Python virtual environments to scan them for documentation. This is done using the `devildex-register-project` companion script.

**Important:** You must run this script from within the **activated virtual environment** of the project you wish to register.

1. **Activate your project's virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # Example for a Poetry project
    poetry shell
    # Or for a standard venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```son

2. **Navigate to your project's root directory:**
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    ```

3. **Run the registration script:**
    ```bash
    devildex-register-project
    ```
    If your project's root directory is different from your current working directory, you can specify it:
    ```bash
    devildex-register-project --project-path /path/to/your/project
    ```

After successful registration, DevilDex will be able to identify and manage documentation for the packages installed in that project's virtual environment.

## Contributing ü§ù

Contributions are welcome! If you want to contribute to DevilDex, here‚Äôs how you can run the test suite.

**Running Tests**

The project uses `pytest`. To run the full test suite:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

**Running UI Tests Headlessly**

The UI tests are designed to run in a headless environment (like in a CI pipeline) using `Xvfb`. To run them this way, use:

```bash
xvfb-run poetry run pytest
```

## Integrazione con Gemini CLI

Per permettere a `gemini-cli` di interagire con `devildex`, √® necessario registrare il server MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrato.

Assicurati che il server `devildex` sia in esecuzione prima di usare gli strumenti in `gemini-cli`.

### Metodo Raccomandato (Script Automatico)

Questo metodo rileva automaticamente il tuo sistema operativo e aggiorna la configurazione di `gemini-cli` in modo sicuro.

1.  Assicurati di avere Python installato.
2.  Dalla cartella principale del progetto, esegui lo script:

    ```bash
    python setup_gemini_cli.py
    ```

Lo script configurer√† tutto il necessario.

### Metodo Alternativo (Comando Manuale)

Se preferisci non eseguire lo script, puoi aggiungere la configurazione manualmente con questo comando:

```bash
gemini mcp add devildex --transport http http://127.0.0.1:8001/mcp --description "DevilDex MCP Server"
```
