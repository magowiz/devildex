# DevilDex
![DevilDex Logo](src/devildex/imgs/logo-final.png)

**DevilDex is a desktop application for discovering, generating, and viewing Python package documentation (docsets).** It scans your projects for dependencies, builds their documentation, and provides a unified interface to browse it all locally.

It's designed for developers who want quick, offline access to the documentation of the libraries they use every day.

## Key Features

-   **Project Scanning**: Automatically scans your Python projects (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`) to find all their dependencies.
-   **Docset Generation**: Uses tools like Sphinx, pdoc, and pydoctor to generate HTML documentation for your packages.
-   **Integrated Viewer**: A built-in browser view to read and navigate the generated docsets without leaving the application.
-   **Database Management**: Uses SQLAlchemy to keep track of your packages, projects, and available docsets.
-   **Cross-Platform GUI**: Built with the wxPython framework to run on multiple operating systems.
